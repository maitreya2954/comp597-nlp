This repository is for the survey study conducted as a part of COMP597 NLP class in PennState University. The topic of study is **Text Style Transfer**. The timeline were adjusted a bit in order to compensate the lack of papers before 2010.

### Introduction

Culture, individual characteristics, and social context have been attributed to linguistic variations in spoken and written language [Eckert and Rickford, 2001, Coupland, 2007]. An individual’s gender, age, education level, personality, and emotional state are some of the personal characteristics that are represented in their writing style. Different people have different ways of expressing themselves, and these characteristics are mirrored in their writing style [Labov, 1972]. However, style evolves over time [Eckert and Rickford, 2001] and we adapt to a given social context, audience, communicator, and/or occasion formal- ity [Kiesling and Schilling-Estes, 1998]. While direct mapping of sociolinguistic categories is not always possible, natural language understanding and generation research has classified stylistic properties along multiple dimensions.

Text style transfer refers to the process of changing the style of a sentence by rewriting the original sentence in a new style while retaining its semantic content. The range of language types is mirrored in the field’s research interests. Some scholars defined style transfer as the ability to change the emotional content of a written document, while others associated it with formality or politeness. Changing the sentiment polarity of a sentence can alter the meaning of a text or transform the message it conveys, but the ability to change the emotional content in a written text should be viewed more in terms of adjusting the tone of a message to be more appropriate, emphatic, and less severe or offensive to the audience or conversational partner. Other researchers have focused their efforts on developing a far more sound understanding of style as a genre, or the language style of a person or a certain social group.

The main reason for doing the study in this work was the recent progress made in text style transfer using deep learning. A systematic review and implementation of the research spanning across the previous decade shows the trends that seemed to hold true across studies as well as the differences and variations in how deep learning is used to spread styles. This review focuses on how encoder-decoder-based designs still rule the field, even though Generative Adversarial Networks have been used to move toward adversarial learning. Even though it seems like choosing one deep neural network over another has nothing to do with style, researchers always have to find a way to balance the trade-offs between the complexity of a model and the predicted performance gains added by extra parts (like a classifier or a discriminator). The review is based on the key stages of the style transfer process and the different research methods that have been used at each step. Transfer learning and multitask learning studies are the opportunities that could make further progress possible. Interpretability is a recurring challenge that is shared across respective fields – a better understanding of what stylistic indicators are captured and learned by neural models might elucidate the nature of stylistic variations in language.
