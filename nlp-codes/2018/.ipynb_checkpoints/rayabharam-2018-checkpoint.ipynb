They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

      " Class 0 Example: Do not get oil change here!!! They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

      " Class 0 Example: Do not get oil change here!!! They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere! Rediculous freddys is what they should be called. Done with them. CustomerCustomerCustomerCustomerCustomer <mask> . | Probs: [0.15, 0.85] \n",

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

      " Class 0 Example: Do not get oil change here!!! They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere! Rediculous freddys is what they should be called. Done with them. CustomerCustomerCustomerCustomerCustomer <mask> . | Probs: [0.15, 0.85] \n",

They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere!

Just one bartender/waitress serving half of the people in the restaurant. ScoreScoreScoreScoreScore <mask> . | Probs: [0.02, 0.98] \n",
